# YIM
The YIM Multi-Tasking Voice-Controlled Robot project presents an innovative, voiceoperated
robotic system designed to serve as a smart assistant and service bot for diverse
applications, including classroom navigation, home automation, and safety monitoring. This
project integrates advanced voice recognition, sensor-based navigation, and IoT-enabled
automation to execute multiple tasks seamlessly via offline voice commands.

#MANUAL

1. Introduction
The YIM Robot is a voice-controlled, multitasking assistant designed for home automation, classroom navigation, and safety monitoring. It combines offline voice recognition, RFID navigation, and IoT capabilities to perform tasks like object transportation, appliance control, and environmental sensing.
Key Features:
•	Offline voice commands (no internet required).
•	Magnetic tape and RFID-based indoor navigation.
•	3D robotic arm for lightweight object handling.
•	Wi-Fi/Bluetooth-enabled home automation.
•	Temperature monitoring.


#2. Safety Information
⚠️ Warnings:
•	Do not expose to water or humid environments.
•	Avoid collisions with obstacles to prevent sensor damage.
•	Keep fingers/hair away from robotic arm during operation.
•	Charge the battery only with the provided 12V adapter.
•	Power off before cleaning or maintenance.
•	Avoid over load operation with 3D arm (max. weight 100-150g)
•	Battery protection, do not drop the lipo battery voltage below 10v.

#3. Setup Instructions
3.1 Powering On
1.	Slide the 2A rocker switch to the "ON" position.

2.	The OLED display will show a robotic face animation and the robot will say “YIM is activated”.
3.2 Initial Voice Setup
1.	Wake-Up Command: Activate the robot by saying "Hey YIM", "Hello YIM", or simply "YIM". Once awakened, the robot remains in active listening mode for 1 minute, allowing you to issue subsequent commands without repeating the wake-up phrase.
